## About The Project

During a trip to the beach, I used a ride app to get to my destination. 
Coincidentally, two of the people in the car worked at a technology company - 
the area that I love - and commented about a slowness in the pre-processing stage.

I got involved in the talk and, when I understood the company's processes, 
I thought of a possible solution to this problem. I presented the idea and they passed their 
contacts to me so that, as soon as we returned from the trip, it was developed and sent to analyze 
the feasibility.

This repository has the solution and the proposal / storytelling sent to them, removing confidential 
data that is not related to the solution.
